# PyTorch Models:
## Image Classifier:
In this folder you can find the model that are trained on the cat-dog images. The model accuracy is 0.5% almost good while training images are 10 but the result is likely good & also you can find 2 program one where we used fixed learning rates (lr) & donot used any quantized aware training (QAT) & another program where we use both two tech and getting better accuracy using both tech lr is updating the weight during learning its good dynamic not always fixed & QAT is converting float32 to int8 less memory usage (small model) portable & good result in all devices.
Also we have another program trained on MNIST dataset that predict image number of 0-9 check this also.
